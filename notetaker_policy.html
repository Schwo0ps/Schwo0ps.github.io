	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p>The Noteworthy Note Taker app does not collect or transmit any
	personal information, such as name, contact information, or file data.
	Some features of the application involve using
	sensors and data stored on the phone, such as loading an image from
	the gallery to draw on or record audio from the microphone in the
	audio note types. All of these features are explicitly stated and
	align with the purposes of the application. The user always makes
	the knowledgeable decision themselves to use any sensor or file data.</p>
